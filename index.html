    <main>
        <p>Student of Otago studying Computer Science. I will be graduating at the end of this year (2017)</p>
        <p>
            I enjoy front end work on websites working with the customer to achive their excpetations. I have had exsprence in many different
        parts of software development. There have been sevral times using a databases with a website using PHP and SQL, working
        with HTML,CSS,Javascript and PHP has been used outside of the class room with making websites for myself and my mothers
        business. I use java or python to do most of my programs that are only used to worked something out, i dont really
        use C as a program to jump to and use but C++ has been good learning. Desgin is a big part of my development with
        having everthing look pretty and the layout correct for the user to enjoy and follow. Electronics is quite fun with
        the desgin of a PCB and making the circuit come to life. I enjoy Illustrator and Photoshop for designing logos and
        pages for both websites and programs.
